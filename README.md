Nivasnow is a web-based Hotel Booking Management System developed to automate and simplify the hotel room booking process. The website allows users to search for hotels, view available rooms, and manage bookings through an easy and user-friendly interface. It reduces the need for manual booking and helps improve accuracy and efficiency.

The system is designed to assist hotel administrators in managing room availability, customer details, and booking records in an organized manner. By using web technologies, Nivasnow provides a digital solution that saves time and enhances the overall booking experience for both customers and hotel management.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of front-end and back-end web development concepts and is suitable for small to medium-sized hotels. The system can be further enhanced by adding features such as online payments, user authentication, and hotel reviews.
